# ðŸ§­ Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

This project implements a solver for the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** â€” a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to find the **shortest possible route** that visits each city **exactly once** and returns to the starting city.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Description

Given:
- A list of `N` cities
- 2D coordinates of each city
- A full distance matrix between all pairs of cities

Your task is to compute the shortest tour that:
- Starts at any city
- Visits each city exactly once
- Returns to the starting point

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

Your program must read from **standard input** with the following structure:

First line: EUCLIDEAN or NON-EUCLIDEAN
Second line: Integer N (number of cities)
Next N lines: 2D coordinates (used only for display)
Next N lines: N space-separated floats â€” distance matrix

9.110738 13.285327 0.0 7.822640 10.096052
3.187861 5.736168 7.822640 0.0 2.419287
4.302992 4.420019 10.096052 2.419287 0.0

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output Format

The output is written to **standard output** as:

- A single line per tour (in path representation)
- City indices are **zero-based** (`0` to `N-1`)
- Each line is a valid complete tour

### ðŸ”¹ Example Output

1 2 4 0 3
0 1 3 4 2
4 3 2 0 1
